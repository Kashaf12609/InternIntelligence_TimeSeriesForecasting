# InternIntelligence_TimeSeriesForecasting
# 📈 Store Sales Time Series Forecasting

This project is developed as part of the **InternIntelligence Internship Program**.  
It focuses on building **time series forecasting models** to predict store sales using historical data.  

The project demonstrates the use of statistical models and machine learning approaches to understand seasonal patterns, trends, and future demand.
